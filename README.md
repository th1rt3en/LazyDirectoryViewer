# LazyDirectoryViewer
[![Carthage Compatible](https://img.shields.io/badge/Carthage-compatible-4BC51D.svg?style=flat)](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage)

Visualize the directory structure at certain path, most probably `Documents/` or `Library` for iOS. These classes are created due to the difficulty to inspect the contents and subdirectories recursively at certain path.


## Requirements
- iOS 9.0+
- Swift 3.0+

## Usage
Create the viewer by `LazyDirectoryViewer.create()` and set the `directoryURL` for the directory you want to view. 

## Installation
### Carthage
```
github "th1rt3en/LazyDirectoryViewer"
```
### Source
Drag all files in `Source` folder to your project
